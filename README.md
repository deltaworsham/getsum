Health Data Aggregator

This is the parent repository for a health data aggregator project. The high level goal is to provide applications that allow users to aggregate and display user health and fitness data from various manufacturers and platforms in one interface across all of their devices.

We want to create UI's for native apps (Android/iOS/Windows/MacOS) that display user fitness and health data. 

We will also want to create a user hosted aggregation application, a middleware that pulls health data from as many platforms as possible or facilitates manual uploads of data from said platforms.

Or aforementioned native UI applications will function as a display layer for the above aggregation middleware.

We will include brief descriptions of what each submodule in this parent repo is here as we add them. If your a contributor please use this as the central repository and link out to other repositories using git submodule add from this parent.
